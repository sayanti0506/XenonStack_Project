# XenonStack_Project 

As per the given problem statement by Xenonstack team I have made a website and for that I have choosen the theme "Ecommerce". 

I have made an online shopping site named as "Sayanti's Fashion Store" in which I have put a "Home page" along with "Contact Us", "About Us" and a "Login" page. 

1. The frontend codes for those pages are in "Html" and for styling the pages I have used "Css Styling.
 
2. In Home page the user will get a "Get Started" option which will lead him to the Login page and by logging in he will get to go into the website.
 
3. In the Contact Us page the user can find our contact details and can also raise their queries and feedback to us. 

4. By visiting our About Us page a new user can get to know about our services and policies clearly. 

5. I have deployed the whole website in "AWS Cloud Computing platform". I have created a new "EC2 Instance" and uploaded all the required files in the instance through "WinSCP". Now the website is running successfully in the browser through the link I have already sent through mail .

You need to paste the working project link in any browser and that's it , you will get to see my shopping site. 

Thank you !!
